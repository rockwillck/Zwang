# Zwang
Zwang is a tiny documentation tool I made for [Lenoir](https://github.com/rockwillck/lenoir), a JavaScript framwork. As such, it's not super extensible or capable, but it is really lightweight and simple to run.
## Setup
First, download the `zwang.py` file through `git clone` or by just clicking the file and then `Download raw file`.  
Label any method inside a class using 
```javscript
/* ++ method summary
further description
including multiline!
-- */
```
Navigate to the `zwang.py` file using `cd` and run `python zwang.py`.
> The following step is optional. It makes the python file accessible without the python tag.  

While in the same directory, run `cp zwang.py ~ && chmod +X ~/zwang.py`.  
Then, in any directory, you can run Zwang using `~/zwang.py`.
